            <figcaption>Nike's Evolution 6 Running Shoe
                <p>Made with at least 20% recycled content by weight, this version features touchpoints at the heel and
                     tongue for easy on and off. It has a softer ride than its predecessor with a foam that helps create a 
                     natural piston effect for even better flexibility.</p>
